title: Agricultural Bioterrorism - A Threat Assessment
author: C. Cherry
published: 14-Jul-2014
description: The threat of agricultural bioterrorism remains one of the single greatest threats to local and state economies, as well as the overall U.S. economy. In worst case scenarios, specific vulnerabilities could be exploited by highly capable actors which would extend damage beyond farreaching economic losses, and threaten broader domestic food security and continuity. This threat assessment will bridge the gap in agricultural bioterrorism scholarship while hopefully spurring a wider and more routine discussion on the subject.
